==== Demo Chapter

Let's try making some example code:
[code]
  == section [red header]?
[end]
or code?

Another try: now we do a list.
- This is a good list
- We will do it properly
  -- by making it a nested
- And unnested list
I will make a test of [red [pLs]paren] vs. [ul [pRs]stuff]. Yeah.

[table]
  [+header0] [+header1] [+header2] .
  [R+M_0_0]   [+M_0_1]   [+M_0_2] [+M_0_3] .
  [3+M_1_0]                       [+M_1_3] .
  [+M_2_0]   [C2+[red really long text which]]    [+M_2_3]  .
  [+M_3_0]   [+M_3_1]   [+M_3_2] [+M_3_3] 
[end]

Here is an image:

I don't know how it will work..
